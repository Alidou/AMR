              Version 1.5
            </h3>
            <p>
              From this version, All Mangas Reader is open source (licence has not been yet chosen) and source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/AllMangasReader-dev/AMR">GitHub</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will make AMR evolve faster ! Anyone can fork All Mangas Reader's code and fix issues. If you want to participate, ask to enter the developer team on the forum !
            </p>
            <p>
              AMR is now automatically packaged from GitHub code and the release process is lighter than before. We should be able to produce more versions and to fix bugs faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              A beta channel has been created to allow anyone to have the latest fix in their AMR. If you use the beta channel. Your AMR will be updated each time a commit is made on GitHub. You should encounter bugs, regression but you will help us a lot by being able to declare new issues on GitHub !
              <br />Note that if you are on the beta channel, you will have to uninstall AMR before returning to stable channel. Both versions can be downloaded from AMR's main website.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of AMR V1.5 was to migrate the extension to Manifest V2. Google Chrome changed their security policy and whole parts of the extension were not compliant with these requirements. We had to recode a lot of things...

                <ul>
                  <li>Internationalisation : The future version will view all AMR's texts externalized so translator can easily translate the extension</li>
                  <li>Change the way data is stored in the extension : your manga list and parameters will be more safe and easier to synchronize (no more bookmarks synchronization</li>
                </ul>

              From this version, All Mangas Reader does not include any websites implementations.
              They are all hosted at
              <a href="http://community.allmangasreader.com/">All Mangas Reader Community</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              This will make AMR evolve faster ! On this community, developers can update
              websites implementations as soon as bugs appear. Validators validate implementations
              if they work and release it so any AMR user will have it in his AMR without
              any new release of the extension !
            </p>
            <p>
              Every user can report issues or website requests on this new website to
              help the community

                      Developer name : I published all previous websites on AMR Community even

                    <li>
                      Revision : latest version number of the implementation. If you are a developer
                      or a validator, when you test a non released version of a website, this
                      revision number turns as temporary and is replaced by a button "Release"
                      which allows you to replace your temporary version by the latest released
                      and continue receiving updates for this website.

                  There was a "Stop Follow updates" button which allows you to prevent AMR
                  from notifying you about updates on a manga. Stop updating prevent AMR
                  from checking latest published chapters for a manga. Mangas on which "Stop
                  updating" is on appeared darkened in the popup

                <br>
                I took time to make this release because I have less free time than I
                used to have...
                <br>
                Next release (unless big issues appears) will be 1.4 !
                <br>
                In 1.4, all websites implementations will be removed from AMR. They will
                be hosted on a new website :
                <strong>
                  All Mangas Reader Community
                </strong>
                .
                <br>
                This collaborative website will allow you to have websites implementations
                up-to-date even if I don't release a new AMR version :
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  developers will be able to post their updates which will be released automatically
                  (without a new AMR release) after being validated. They will be able to
                  add new implementations too
                </li>
                <li>
                  validators will have in charge to test developers implementation and to
                  release them
                </li>
                <li>
                  users will be able to post issues concerning websites implementations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              This website will use your login password on the forum. As more and more
              developers are publishing fix for websites on the forum, I think they deserve
              a proper way to update website and release it as soon as possible. Hope
              you will enjoy it !

                      To keep good relations with batoto admins, ads are not removed from chapters
                      page even if the option is checked. While updating chapters, batoto chapters
                      are updated one by one. I recommend you to set the chapters update frequency
                      at least to 6 hours to not flood Batoto.

                  ? What skin suits you the best ? Personnaly, I prefer the dark-red / black
                  one. And you (please answer on the forum...) ?

                  MangaStream changed their layout for the new chapters they publish. AMR
                  recognize both layouts. (As you are about 3000 to read new chapters for
                  Naruto, Bleach and One Piece on MangaStream, I released this version for
                  you)

                  left / right key functionnality for MangaStream and for little scans.

                  Change the left / right key behaviour. Left key always goes to previous

                  key goes to top next scan, then to the bottom of the scan, then to the
                  next scan... If you are at the bottom of the last scan, it goes to the
                  bottom of the page. This way of reading has been discussed on the forum.

                  AMR did not display correctly the manga list depending on categories states
                  (include / exclude / none)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some mangas in MangaFox had no title and tied up with the first manga

                <li>
                  On the pop-out page, the categories do not follow the page when it is

                </li>
                <li>
                  Mangafox pulls in the "." key to go to the next page in the chapter, so
                  when you're typing in a bookmark comment and you add a period, it refreshes.

                  and "refresh now" button) and visit latest chapter read for each manga

                  from the site url which was http://beta.manga-access.com/... for a week.
                  This has been fixed in AMR too so it won't happen again.

                This version has been created only to ensure the migration to 1.3.0. Indeed,
                as google chrome does not want to host AMR anymore, I need to host it myself.
                But I can not use the same extension ID as before because it is owned by
                google. So, the new version has a new ID and AMR 1.2.99 has been made to
                allow users to reuse their manga list in the new AMR.

                Some of you have reported Malware warnings from AMR. The problem is that
                AMR access the web site www.thespectrum.net which is detected as containing
                malware by Avast and other free antiviruses... On thespectrum web site,
                in the FAQ, you can read this :

                  Why is my antivirus saying your site is bad ?
                </strong>
                I've received this question a few times and the bottom line is my website
                does NOT have viruses. I've received these questions from people using
                Internet Explorer 6, easily one of the most virus-prone browsers out there.
                I've used countless virus-free computers to access this website and no
                antivirus program has ever told me my site was infected. I believe that
                those emailing my asking why my site says it's infected already have pre-existing
                viruses on their computer because they haven't taken the measures to protect
                their computer. Every computer needs to either have the updated Internet
                Explorer 7, or updated versions of other browsers such as Firefox and Opera.
                Users, especially those using Windows XP, should do some research and get
                good programs like ESET Smart Security, which is better than the numerous
                free antivirus programs out there.

                Ignore it since antiviruses fix their virus base... If you are not sure
                of this web site, desactivate TheSpectrum web site in the option page,
                AMR will then not access this web site anymore.

                Some of you have reported bugs on MangaStream (some scans are a little
                distorted). I can not reproduce this bug. If you still have it, can you
                let me know the manga and chapter on which it occurs, your screen resolution
                and the value of your AMR options "Resize scans images to fit screen if
                they are to wide" and if you display chapters as a book or not (and a link
                to a picture of the bug if you have one). Thanks !

              </p>
              <p>
                MangaStream's changes were more complex than expected... I finally fixed
                them and change the way I build scans images because it was consuming a
                lot (A LOT) of memory... It is now lighter and more efficient (you won't
                have some parts of the image on top of the scans anymore... until they
                rechange their web site...). (If you look close to MangaStream page code,
                you will see that scans are composed of multiple little parts images of
                the scan AND of images that are not related to the scan but which are displayed
                under the real scans part in order to disturb AMR... That won't disturb
                it anymore...)

                All Mangas Reader won't display the release note of new versions spontaneously

                Fixed bug on MangaStream and StopTazmo
              </p>
              <p>
                The MangaStream bug was not due to AMR previous release but to a big,
                big change in MangaStream web site...
                <br>
                I suspect them to have waited for a new AMR release to publish their latest
                version...
                <br>
                For your information, MangaStream does not like AMR extension... I tried
                to negociate with them (force ads for MangaStream in the extension, ...)
                but they just want AMR to not work with MangaStream, ... according to their
                own words : "Let's the fight begin...".
                <br>
                This time, they have splitted scans images in multiple little images (which
                position and size are randomized), so this will be very difficult for AMR
                to build back the images and insert it in the full chapter way...
                <br>

                Fixed bug on SomeManga and SomeMango : SomeManga changed the way their
                web site works. The full list of manga can now not be retrieved. AMR will
                ask you to key search words to find mangas for this web site. The list
                of chapters problem has been fixed.

                Version 1.2.3
              </h3>
              <p>
                As I received many requests, I added the following features :
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Added an option to prevent images from being resized to fit the page.
                  If you have a small resolution, uncheck this option so the scans won't
                  be resized
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added an option to change the background color of the popup. As some of
                  you prefered the black background, they can choose to come back to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added an option to load scans in the order of the chapter. If you check
                  it, the first scan will be loaded first then the second and so on. Checking
                  this option will slow down the chapter loading but it is indicated if your
                  connection is slow. In this case you don't have to wait too much time to
                  start reading your chapter.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Added a delete button on the "rate the extension" panel in mangas web
                  site. Clicking on this button will automatically uncheck the associated
                  option so you won't have this panel anymore.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fixed the problem with SomeManga
